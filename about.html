        <h3 class="about__subtitle">Warning: asks a lot of questions</h3>
        <p>
          My inquisitive nature means that I experience the world as an endless
          opportunity for learning.

          Superpower: can hold a conversation with anyone
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before attending the Founders and Coders bootcamp , I worked as a
          community pharmacist. Giving over 200 flu vaccinations a season gave
          me the ability to sit in a tiny room with anyone and distract them
          from the fact that a needle is about to go into their arm.
        </p>

        <h3 class="about__subtitle">Seeking: balance</h3>
        <p>
          Outside work, I enjoy attending and mentoring at Codebar, consuming
          any and all media I can get my hands on, and crafting things out of
          yarn.
